## Release

Before cutting a release, upstream Playwright creates a branch named eg. `release-1.29`.
They then cherry-pick fixes onto the branch before creating a release from that branch.

To improve compatibility, we'll follow roughly the same release process.

1. When upstream makes a release branch, create an `abq/release-*` branch from `release-*`.
1. Merge `abq/main` into `abq/release-*`.
  1. If there are any conflicts, stop merging and [resolve conflicts on abq/main](#resolving-conflicts) first.
1. Release `playwright-test-abq` [as described below](#releasing-playwright-test-abq).

Our `main` branch tracks upstream's `main`.

### Releasing playwright-test-abq

Update the versions in [abq/version.ts](./packages/playwright-test/src/abq/version.ts).
`testFrameworkVersion` should be the `version` from the [root package.json](./package.json).
`adapterVersion` should be the ABQ version to release.

Commit the resulting [abq/version.ts](./packages/playwright-test/src/abq/version.ts) changes.

Perform the release from the `abq/release-*` branch.

Update the `version` in `package.json` for the packages we'll release to the **ABQ version**.
This change will not be committed to git.

- `playwright-core`
- `playwright-test`

Run [prepare_release.js](./utils/prepare_release.js):
```bash
node utils/prepare_release.js
```

Perform a build then release:
```bash
npm run build
npm publish --access=public ./packages/playwright-core
npm publish --access=public ./packages/playwright-test
```

### Resolving conflicts

Don't resolve merge conflicts directly in a release branch if at all possible.

First, find the parent commit in the upstream `release-*` branch that's in upstream's `main`.
Merge that commit into `abq/main` and resolve conflicts.
